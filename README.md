MyConnector
===========

This is an old project (worked on it 2004-2007) of mine that is
currently inactive.  It's main purpose is a social bookmarking web
site with search engine capabilities.  The idea is that you can search
the *content* of the pages of you have bookmarked, as well as those of
your friends or all the users of the web site.  There was also privacy
settings for each bookmark in case you wanted to bookmark something
only you could see or only your friends could see.  If you ever saw
Yahoo's MyWeb2.0 (does it still exist?), they ended up implementing
exactly what I was going for.

The social bookmarking and search features do actually work, though
there are still some bugs.  I'd like to revisit this project at some
point, probably in the form of a re-write.  In a rewrite, I would not
write my own search engine functionality and would look at something
like [Nutch](http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/) for that part.

This project also ended up being a place for experimentation on other
unrelated ideas, but they are mostly incomplete:

* File release system
* Timesheet
* Todo list (which became a separate project)

This is written in Java and used Spring and Hibernate.
